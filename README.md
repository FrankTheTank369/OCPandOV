OCP: Opportunities Created Percentage; OV: Offensive Value

OCP is comparable to Fangraphs’ wOBA as an all-encompassing offensive statistic. OCP is a better metric, because wOBA focuses on a player’s overall offensive ability, whereas OCP focuses on a player’s ability to create baserunning opportunities and scoring chances for both himself and his teammates. OCP measures every aspect that a player can advance a base, including hits, walks, hit-by-pitches, stolen bases, sacrifice flies, and sacrifice hits.

OCP is better used as a day-to-day metric to compare players and analyze performance, whereas OV is better used as an overall evaluation metric to evaluate players, such as determining player contracts. Offensive Value is similar to OCP in measuring a player’s offensive skill-set, however it differs in that it factors in strikeouts as a negative against players.

The Wins value is derived from OCP and is meant to be an alternative to WAR. It shares the same concept as WAR, as one number to evaluate a player. I used Fangraphs’ WAR calculation as a base for my Win value. I designed it to be used to measure how many wins a player contributes to rather than compared to a replacement player. This is not to say that it is a direct correlation. For example, if the Angels were to get rid of Mike Trout, they would not necessarily win 21 less games. The win value determines that Trout’s performance contributed to a value of 21 wins.

Starting in 2020 and moving forward, sacrifice hits and sacrifice flies will be replaced with Productive Outs. Productive Outs include sacrifice hits and sacrifice flies, as well as other out types that advance baserunners. The Productive Outs fit these stats better as an all-encompassing metric to measure each way possible for players to create baserunning opportunities and scoring chances.
